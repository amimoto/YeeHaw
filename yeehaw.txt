$Description "ControlledDifficulty where headshots return the ammo back to the chamber.

Changes from vanilla survival:

* Aim-wisely and never run out of ammo: Headshots will not use ammo.
* Pistol head bashes will give ammo (good way of earning ammo with trash)
* Trader is quiet
* Full integration with ControlledDifficulty

Differences from previous version.

* No longer Gunslingers only
* No longer spawn with default loadout
* No longer waves of insane last waves
* Trader time is back

Possible issues:

* As there's some funny business happening under the hood to handle skills, there may be some issues such as skills not being active though it looks like they should be

Making this puppy run:

* Start Killing Floor 2
* Hit tilde ~ to bring down the console
* Enter in the following: open kf-burningparis?game=YeeHaw.YH_Survival
* Swap kf-burningparis for other maps (eg. kf-outpost)
* Change difficulty by supplying another difficulty parameter. So for HoE it could be: open kf-burningparis?game=YeeHaw.YH_Survival?Difficulty=3 (Note: 0=Normal)
* All usual parameters for ControlledDifficulty are also available here
