$Description "Gunslingers only! Headshots return the bullet back to your magazine. Start the game with full loadout and it's a full set of hardest wave mayhem!

Changes from vanilla survival:

* Only Gunslingers Allowed
* Always spawn with dual-1911, dual-deagles, dual-500s, and medic pistol
* Aim-wisely and never run out of ammo: Headshots will not use ammo.
* Pistol head bashes will give ammo (good way of earning ammo with trash)
* Level 25 skill Whirlwind of Lead users can get additional ammo by getting headshots
* No tradertime. Non-stop Zed killing action. Waves still exist to let people (re)spawn

Making this puppy run:

* Start Killing Floor 2
* Hit tilde ~ to bring down the console
* Enter in the following: open kf-burningparis?game=YeeHaw.YH_Survival
* Swap kf-burningparis for other maps (eg. kf-outpost)
* Change difficulty by supplying another difficulty parameter. So for HoE it could be: open kf-burningparis?game=YeeHaw.YH_Survival?Difficulty=3 (Note: 0=Normal)
